# Instructions

1: unzip pde2path

2: Run setpde2path - change folder if you have to.

3: Run cmds_ex file in the schnakfold folder. Add the entire folder to the path.



# Information
pde2path contains all the libraries (which are too big to upload individually) and schnakfold is a tutorial directory which I've changed slightly. files containing edits are everything except the _other_ cmds files.
